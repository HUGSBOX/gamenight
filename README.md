Development of an amateur RPG game made by some boys from NS.<br>
Currently in very (very) early stage.  A placefiller sprite can shoot a placefiller projectile toward the right side of the screen, at nothing.  Much of what gets changed in this stage is the foundation of the game mechanics, and not the development of an actual gameplay experience yet..<br>
Currently trying to develop functional combat mechanics, and designing our first set of sprites.<br>
Absolutely no image currently present in the game will be present in the "end" product, whatever/whenever that may be.

<h1>NOTES</h1><br>
When you kill the zombie, walking over its death site will still kill you.  This will be fixed very soon.

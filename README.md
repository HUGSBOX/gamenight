Development of an amateur RPG game made by some boys from NS.

<br>

Currently in very (very) early stage.  Much of what gets changed in this stage is the foundation of the game, and not the development of an actual gameplay experience yet..

Currently working on combat mechanics, and designing our first set of sprites.

Images currently present in the game will not necessarily be present in the "end" product, whatever/whenever that may be.

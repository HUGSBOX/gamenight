Development of an amateur RPG game made by some boys from NS.
Currently in very (very) early stage.  A placefiller sprite can shoot a placefiller projectile toward the right side of the screen, at nothing.  Much of what gets changed in this stage is the foundation of the game mechanics, and not the development of features or an actual gameplay experience yet..<br>
Currently trying to develop functional combat mechanics.
